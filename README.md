### Important note
It is a messenger bot that I created to help people learn new languages with quizzes. It's small, but good overview of my code.

It's not perfect. Sometimes it grows a bit chaotically, but I always make sure to comment my code well so that it remains understandable. And there are definitely a lot of things that I'd like to improve.

So, if you're preparing for an interview with me, it's important to know that I'm aware of the flaws in my project and I'm always happy to talk about it. One thing that I intentionally did was to not use frameworks because I wanted to challenge myself and explore different approaches.
